# Architecture

## Overall Architecture

Acero Applications follows a modern web application architecture based on Next.js with a full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript approach. The architecture employs:

1. **Frontend**: React-based UI with Next.js framework
2. **Backend**: Next.js API routes and Express.js server
3. **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
4. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit and Zustand
5. **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO

## Architectural Patterns

The application implements several architectural patterns:

### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Models**: Mongoose schemas in `/src/models/` directory
- **Views**: React components in `/src/components/` and `/src/app/` directories
- **Controllers**: API route handlers in `/src/app/api/` directory

### 2. Service-Oriented Architecture
- Clear separation between service layers
- API endpoints organized by domain in `/src/services/endpoints/`
- Reusable service components in `/src/services/`

### 3. Component-Based UI Architecture
- Reusable UI components in `/src/components/`
- Page-specific components in respective page directories

```

## Authentication and Authorization

The application uses Next-Auth for authentication, providing:
- User authentication via credentials
- Session management
- Role-based access control

Authorization is implemented using:
- Custom middleware
- Role and permission checking
- Access control at component and API levels

## Data Flow

1. **Request Flow**:
   - Client request → Next.js middleware → API route → Service → Data manager → Database
   - Response follows the reverse path

2. **State Management**:
   - Redux for global application state
   - Zustand for more localized state management
   - React Query for server state and caching

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Socket.IO integration for real-time notifications
   - WebSocket connections for live updates

## Error Handling

The application implements comprehensive error handling:
- API error responses with consistent format
- Error boundaries in React components
- Error logging and monitoring
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Performance Considerations

- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and initial load
- Client-side navigation for SPA-like experience
- Optimized MongoDB queries with proper indexing
- Lazy loading of components and modules

## Security Measures

- CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Environment variable management for sensitive data
