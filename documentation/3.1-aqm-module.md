# AQM (Acero Quotation Manager) Module

## Overview

The AQM (Acero Quotation Manager) module is a comprehensive quotation and proposal management system within the Acero Applications suite. It handles the entire quotation lifecycle from initial customer inquiries to final proposal submissions, including versioning and revisions.

## Core Components

### 1. Models

The AQM module is built around the following data models:

#### Quotation Model (`src/models/aqm/QuotationModel.model.ts`)
- Central model for quotation management
- Stores customer information, project details, quotation terms
- Links to related proposal documents and revisions

#### Proposals Model (`src/models/aqm/Proposals.model.ts`)
- Manages proposal documents associated with quotations
- Stores proposal metadata and references to actual documents

#### ProposalRevisions Model (`src/models/aqm/ProposalRevisions.model.ts`)
- Tracks revisions and version history of proposals
- Enables comprehensive change tracking for compliance and audit purposes

#### Options Model (`src/models/aqm/OptionsModel.model.ts`)
- Manages quotation options and alternative configurations
- Allows for presenting multiple product/service options to customers

### 2. Components

#### AQM Component (`src/components/AQMModelComponent/AQMComponent.tsx`)
- Main UI component for quotation management
- Provides forms and interfaces for creating, viewing, and editing quotations
- Manages validation, submission, and state for quotation data

#### Master Component AQM (`src/components/MasterComponentAQM/MasterComponentAQM.tsx`)
- Higher-level component that orchestrates the AQM workflow
- Integrates with other system components like customer data and approvals

### 3. UI/UX Features

- **Dynamic Form Management**: Flexible form handling for different quotation types
- **Revision Tracking**: Visual indicators and interfaces for revision history
- **Status Workflows**: Clear visualization of quotation status in the pipeline
- **Proposal Preview**: Document preview capabilities for generated proposals
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation to ensure data integrity

## Business Logic

### Quotation Workflow

1. **Creation Phase**:
   - New quotation initiated with basic customer and project info
   - System generates a quotation number based on configured rules
   - Initial details are captured including project scope, timeline, and pricing

2. **Review and Approval**:
   - Internal review process with optional multi-stage approval
   - Quotation may transition through various status states (draft, pending review, approved)
   - Comments and feedback can be provided by reviewers

3. **Revision Management**:
   - Support for multiple revisions with tracking
   - Each revision maintains its own dataset while preserving history
   - Clear versioning for customer-facing documents

4. **Finalization and Submission**:
   - Generation of formal quotation documents
   - Option to email quotations directly to customers
   - Storage of final documentation and customer acceptance

### Key Functions

- **Quotation Creation**: `handleSubmitQuotation()` processes form data and creates new quotation entries
- **Revision Handling**: `addRevisionsToProposal()` manages the revision workflow
- **Document Generation**: Integration with PDF generation for customer-ready documents
- **Email Notifications**: Integration with email service for notifications and quotation delivery
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation through form controls and backend checks

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations

- **Master Data**: Integrates with customer, product, and pricing master data
- **User Management**: Links with user system for assignment and approvals
- **Notification System**: Triggers notifications for status changes and approvals
- **Document Management**: Connects with document storage for proposal attachments

### External Integrations

- **Email System**: Sends quotations and notifications via email service
- **PDF Generation**: Utilizes PDF generation libraries for document creation

## Data Flow

1. User inputs quotation data through the AQM Component
2. Data is validated and processed by form handlers
3. Service APIs are called to persist data to MongoDB
4. Approval workflows are triggered if configured
5. Document generation occurs for customer-facing materials
6. Notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders
7. Revisions follow the same flow with additional version tracking

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- Uses React state hooks for local component state
- Redux for global state related to quotation workflows
- Custom hooks for specialized state management

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/quotations`: Retrieve quotations with filtering options
- `POST /api/quotations`: Create new quotation
- `PUT /api/quotations/:id`: Update existing quotation
- `GET /api/quotations/:id/revisions`: Get revision history
- `POST /api/quotations/:id/revisions`: Add new revision

### Key UI Components

- QuotationDialog: Main interface for quotation data entry and editing
- RevisionManager: Component for handling and displaying revision history
- ProposalViewer: Document preview capability for proposals

## Best Practices and Usage Guidelines

1. **Creating New Quotations**:
   - Ensure all required customer information is available
   - Select appropriate quotation template based on project type
   - Follow the step-by-step form completion process

2. **Managing Revisions**:
   - Always create a formal revision for significant changes
   - Include revision notes explaining the changes
   - Maintain version control through the revision system

3. **Approval Process**:
   - Submit quotations for approval according to company policy
   - Track approval status through the dashboard
   - Address feedback and comments before resubmission

4. **Document Generation**:
   - Review generated documents before sending to customers
   - Use system templates for consistency
   - Store final versions in the document repository
