# Master Data Management

## Overview

The Master Data Management module serves as the foundation for the entire Acero Applications suite, providing standardized reference data and core entity definitions used throughout the application. This module ensures data consistency, integrity, and reusability across all functional areas.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Models

The Master Data module encompasses a comprehensive set of models that define the essential business entities:

#### Organization and Personnel
- **User Model** (`src/models/master/User.model.ts`): Core user entity with authentication details
- **Department Model** (`src/models/master/Department.model.ts`): Organizational department structure
- **Designation Model** (`src/models/master/Designation.model.ts`): Job roles and positions
- **Organisation Model** (`src/models/master/Organisation.model.ts`): Company and organizational details
- **Role Model** (`src/models/master/Role.model.ts`): User roles for access control
- **EmployeeType Model** (`src/models/master/EmployeeType.model.ts`): Categories of employment

#### User Profile Data
- **UserPersonalDetails Model**: Personal information about employees
- **UserBenefits Model**: Employee benefits information
- **UserEmploymentDetails Model**: Employment history and status
- **UserVisaDetails Model**: Visa and immigration information
- **UserIdentification Model**: ID documents and identification details

#### Geographic Data
- **Continent Model**: Continental geographical divisions
- **Region Model**: Regional geographical divisions
- **Country Model**: Country definitions and metadata
- **State Model**: State/province definitions
- **Location Model**: Specific locations and addresses

#### Customer Data
- **Customer Model**: Customer organization information
- **CustomerType Model**: Customer categorization
- **CustomerContact Model**: Contact persons for customers

#### Product Classification
- **IndustryType Model**: Industry sector classifications
- **BuildingType Model**: Types of building structures
- **ProjectType Model**: Categories of projects
- **PaintType Model**: Paint product classifications
- **ProductType Model**: Product categorizations
- **ProductCategory Model**: Product grouping hierarchies
- **UnitMeasurement Model**: Measurement units for products

#### Team Management
- **Team Model**: Team definitions and structures
- **TeamMember Model**: Team composition and memberships
- **TeamRole Model**: Roles within teams

#### Business Reference Data
- **Currency Model**: Currency definitions and exchange rates
- **QuoteStatus Model**: Status codes for quotation workflow
- **ApprovalAuthority Model**: Authority levels for approvals
- **Incoterm Model**: International commercial terms
- **Sector Model**: Business sector classifications

### 2. API Services

The Master Data module provides comprehensive API endpoints for CRUD operations on all master entities:

- **Create**: Add new master data entries with validation
- **Read**: Retrieve master data with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **Update**: Modify existing master data with change tracking
- **Delete**: Remove obsolete master data with referential integrity checks

### 3. UI Components

The module includes specialized components for master data management:

- **Data Tables**: Interactive tables for viewing and managing master data
- **Master Data Forms**: Standardized forms for adding and editing master entities
- **Selection Components**: Dropdown selectors, autocomplete fields, and multi-select components for referencing master data
- **Import/Export Tools**: Facilities for bulk data operations

## Data Relationships

The Master Data module implements complex relationships between entities:

1. **Hierarchical Relationships**:
   - Geographic hierarchies (Continent → Region → Country → State → Location)
   - Organizational hierarchies (Organisation → Department → Teams)
   - Product classification hierarchies (Category → Type → Product)

2. **Many-to-Many Relationships**:
   - Users to Roles
   - Teams to Users
   - Customers to Contacts

3. **Reference Relationships**:
   - Products to Units of Measurement
   - Customers to Customer Types
   - Users to Departments and Designations

## Implementation Details

### Data Consistency

The Master Data module ensures consistency through:

- **Validation Rules**: Schema-level validation for all master data
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevention of duplicate entries
- **Referential Integrity**: Cascading updates and deletion protection
- **Standardization**: Enforced data formats and structures

### Caching Strategy

To optimize performance, the module implements:

- **Client-side Caching**: Common master data cached in frontend state
- **Server-side Caching**: Frequently accessed master data cached in memory
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart update of cached data when changes occur

### Versioning and History

For critical master data, the module maintains:

- **Change History**: Tracking of modifications with timestamps and user information
- **Version Control**: Ability to view historical versions of master data
- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all master data operations

## Integration Points

The Master Data module integrates with all other modules:

1. **AQM Module**: Provides customer, product, and reference data for quotations
2. **HR Wizard**: Supplies organizational structure and employee reference data
3. **Inventory Management**: Provides product categories and measurement units
4. **IT Applications**: Supplies reference data for classification and categorization
5. **Ticket System**: Provides user, team, and department references
6. **SML**: Supplies organizational context for media library organization

## Best Practices

1. **Data Governance**:
   - Establish clear ownership and stewardship for master data
   - Implement approval workflows for critical master data changes
   - Maintain documentation for master data definitions and usage

2. **Data Quality**:
   - Regularly review master data for completeness and accuracy
   - Implement data cleansing procedures for inconsistencies
   - Use validation rules to prevent erroneous data entry

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Pre-load frequently used master data
   - Implement efficient search and filtering mechanisms
   - Use pagination for large master data sets

4. **Integration Usage**:
   - Access master data through service layers rather than direct database queries
   - Subscribe to master data changes to keep dependent modules updated
   - Cache master data appropriately in consuming modules
