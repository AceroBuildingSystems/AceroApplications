# HR Wizard Module

## Overview

The HR Wizard module is a comprehensive human resources management system within the Acero Applications suite. It facilitates employee data management throughout the employment lifecycle, from onboarding to offboarding, including personal information, employment details, benefits, visas, and identification documents.

## Core Components

### 1. Models

The HR Wizard module utilizes several data models to manage employee information:

#### Personal Information
- **UserPersonalDetails Model** (`src/models/master/UserPersonalDetails.model.ts`): Stores personal information such as name, contact details, emergency contacts, and demographic data.

#### Employment Information
- **UserEmploymentDetails Model** (`src/models/master/UserEmploymentDetails.model.ts`): Manages employment-specific information including hire date, contract details, compensation, reporting structure, and job specifications.

#### Benefits and Compensation
- **UserBenefits Model** (`src/models/master/UserBenefits.model.ts`): Tracks employee benefits such as insurance, allowances, retirement plans, and other perks.

#### Visa and Immigration
- **UserVisaDetails Model** (`src/models/master/UserVisaDetails.model.ts`): Manages visa information, expiry dates, work permits, and related documentation.
- **VisaType Model** (`src/models/master/VisaType.model.ts`): Reference data for different types of visas.

#### Identification
- **UserIdentification Model** (`src/models/master/UserIdentification.model.ts`): Stores identification documents such as passport, national ID, driver's license, etc.

## Business Logic

### Employee Onboarding Workflow

1. **Initiation**:
   - Create new employee profile with basic information
   - Generate employee ID and system credentials

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Personal details collection (contact info, emergency contacts)
   - Employment details (position, department, reporting structure)
   - Benefits selection and enrollment
   - Visa and work authorization verification
   - Identification document collection and verification

3. **Review and Approval**:
   - HR review of submitted information
   - Manager approval for certain details
   - Document verification process

4. **Finalization**:
   - Account activation
   - System access provisioning
   - Notification to relevant departments

### Ongoing Management Functions

- **Data Updates**: Process for updating employee information
- **Document Renewal**: Tracking and managing document expiration dates
- **Benefits Changes**: Handling changes in benefits enrollment
- **Performance Tracking**: Integration with performance management
- **Leave Management**: Vacation, sick days, and other leave types

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations

- **User Management**: Links with core user accounts and authentication
- **Department/Role Data**: Integrates with organizational structure from Master Data
- **Document Management**: Connects with document storage for employee files
- **Notification System**: Sends alerts for document expiration, approval requests, etc.

### External Integrations

- **Email System**: Notifications for approvals and document requirements
- **Calendar System**: Integration for onboarding scheduling and important dates

## Data Flow

1. HR initiates employee onboarding through the HR Wizard
2. Employee or HR staff completes information across multiple wizard steps
3. Documents are uploaded and attached to the employee profile
4. Approvals are requested from relevant managers or HR personnel
5. Upon completion, data is stored and made available across the application
6. Notifications are generated for incomplete items or upcoming expirations

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- Uses React state hooks for form state management
- Context providers for sharing data across wizard steps
- Redux for global employee data state

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/employees`: Retrieve employee information
- `POST /api/employees`: Create new employee profiles
- `PUT /api/employees/:id`: Update existing employee data
- `GET /api/employees/:id/documents`: Retrieve employee documents
- `POST /api/employees/:id/documents`: Upload employee documents

### Form Validation

- Frontend validation using Zod schemas
- Backend validation with Mongoose schema constraints
- Custom validation logic for complex business rules

### Document Management

- Secure file upload with type and size validation
- Document categorization and tagging
- Expiration tracking and renewal reminders
