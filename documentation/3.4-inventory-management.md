# Inventory Management Module

## Overview

The Inventory Management module provides comprehensive functionality for tracking, managing, and optimizing inventory and assets within Acero. It enables efficient management of products, warehouses, stock levels, and asset allocation, supporting both operational needs and financial reporting requirements.

## Core Components

### 1. Models

The Inventory Management module is built around several interconnected data models:

#### Product Management
- **Product Model** (`src/models/master/Product.model.ts`): Core product entity with specifications, categorization, and metadata
- **ProductCategory Model** (`src/models/master/ProductCategory.model.ts`): Hierarchical product categorization
- **ProductType Model** (`src/models/master/ProductType.model.ts`): Product type classifications
- **UnitMeasurement Model** (`src/models/master/UnitMeasurement.ts`): Units of measurement for products

#### Asset Management
- **Asset Model** (`src/models/master/Asset.model.ts`): Tracking of company assets, their allocation, and status
- **Vendor Model** (`src/models/master/Vendor.model.ts`): Supplier and vendor information

#### Warehouse and Inventory
- **Warehouse Model** (`src/models/master/Warehouse.model.ts`): Storage locations and facilities
- **Inventory Model** (`src/models/master/Inventory.model.ts`): Current stock levels and inventory movements

### 2. Components

#### Inventory Management Interface
- **Inventory Dashboard**: Overview of inventory status and key metrics
- **Product Catalog**: Browsable and searchable product listing
- **Stock Management**: Tools for updating and reconciling inventory
- **Asset Tracker**: Interface for managing and tracking company assets

#### Operations Components
- **Stock Movement Form**: Interface for recording product movements
- **Stock Count**: Tools for physical inventory counting
- **Reorder Management**: Automatic reorder suggestions based on thresholds
- **Warehouse Management**: Tools for organizing storage locations

### 3. UI/UX Features

- **Real-time Stock Updates**: Live inventory level displays
- **Barcode/QR Integration**: Scanning capabilities for efficient inventory operations
- **Visual Dashboards**: Graphical representation of inventory status
- **Filtering and Search**: Advanced search capabilities for finding products
- **Bulk Operations**: Tools for mass updates and inventory adjustments

## Business Logic

### Inventory Workflow

1. **Product Definition**:
   - Creating product entries with specifications and attributes
   - Assigning categories, types, and units of measurement
   - Establishing pricing information

2. **Stock Management**:
   - Receiving inventory with quality control checks
   - Allocating stock to warehouses and locations
   - Monitoring stock levels against min/max thresholds
   - Recording stock movements (transfers, adjustments)

3. **Asset Lifecycle**:
   - Asset acquisition and registration
   - Assignment to departments or individuals
   - Maintenance tracking
   - Depreciation and disposal management

4. **Reporting and Analysis**:
   - Inventory valuation reports
   - Stock movement analysis
   - Stockout frequency and impact assessment
   - Slow-moving inventory identification

### Key Functions

- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Automated tracking of inventory levels
- **Reordering**: Automated or manual generation of purchase requisitions
- **Stock Transfers**: Movement between warehouses or locations
- **Stock Adjustments**: Reconciliation of physical counts with system records
- **Asset Tracking**: Location and assignment history of assets

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations

- **Procurement**: Integration with purchasing processes
- **Finance**: Inventory valuation for financial reporting
- **AQM**: Product information for quotations
- **Master Data**: Reference data for classification and categorization

### External Integrations

- **Supplier Systems**: Optional EDI or API integration with vendors
- **Barcode/QR Systems**: Integration with scanning hardware
- **Financial Systems**: Data export for accounting purposes

## Data Flow

1. Products are defined in the system with complete specifications
2. Initial inventory is recorded through receiving processes
3. Stock movements are tracked through various transaction types
4. Inventory levels are monitored against thresholds
5. Reporting provides insights into inventory status and optimization opportunities
6. Procurement processes are triggered based on inventory status

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- Real-time inventory state through Redux
- Optimistic UI updates for inventory transactions
- Cache management for product catalog data

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/products`: Retrieve product catalog
- `GET /api/inventory`: Get current inventory levels
- `POST /api/inventory/transactions`: Record inventory movements
- `GET /api/assets`: Retrieve asset information
- `PUT /api/assets/:id/assign`: Update asset assignment

### Data Validation

- Schema validation for product and inventory data
- Business rule validation for inventory transactions
- Stock level checks before fulfillment

### Performance Optimization

- Indexed queries for large inventory datasets
- Paginated product catalog browsing
- Efficient stock movement recording with batch operations
