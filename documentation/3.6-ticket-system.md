# Ticket System Module

## Overview

The Ticket System module provides a comprehensive solution for internal support requests, issue tracking, and task management within Acero. It enables efficient handling of support tickets, assignment of responsibilities, tracking of progress, and documentation of resolutions, facilitating improved service delivery and accountability.

## Core Components

### 1. Models

The Ticket System module is built around several interconnected data models:

#### Core Ticket Management
- **Ticket Model** (`src/models/ticket/Ticket.model.ts`): Central entity for ticket information, status, and relationships
- **TicketCategory Model** (`src/models/ticket/TicketCategory.model.ts`): Classification system for ticket types
- **TicketHistory Model** (`src/models/ticket/TicketHistory.model.ts`): Historical record of ticket status changes and actions

#### Communication and Task Tracking
- **TicketComment Model** (`src/models/ticket/TicketComment.model.ts`): Comments and communications related to tickets
- **TicketTask Model** (`src/models/ticket/TicketTask.model.ts`): Subtasks or action items associated with tickets

#### Skill and Assignment
- **UserSkill Model** (`src/models/ticket/UserSkill.model.ts`): Skills registry for appropriate ticket assignment

### 2. Components

#### User Interfaces
- **Ticket Dashboard**: Overview of tickets with filtering and sorting capabilities
- **Ticket Detail View**: Comprehensive interface for ticket management
- **Ticket Creation Form**: Interface for submitting new support requests
- **Task Management**: Tools for creating and tracking ticket-related tasks

#### Operational Components
- **Assignment Manager**: Tools for assigning tickets to team members
- **Status Workflow**: Controls for moving tickets through their lifecycle
- **Comment System**: Threaded discussion functionality for tickets
- **Task Tracker**: Progress tracking for ticket-related tasks

### 3. UI/UX Features

- **Priority Visualization**: Color-coding and icons for ticket priorities
- **Status Tracking**: Clear indicators of current ticket status
- **Timeline View**: Chronological view of ticket history
- **Filtering and Search**: Advanced search capabilities for finding tickets
- **Notification Indicators**: Visual cues for updates and required actions

## Business Logic

### Ticket Workflow

1. **Creation Phase**:
   - User submits a new ticket with description and category
   - System assigns initial status and priority
   - Optional automatic routing based on category

2. **Assignment and Processing**:
   - Tickets are assigned to appropriate team members
   - Initial assessment and communication
   - Creation of related tasks if needed

3. **Resolution Process**:
   - Work performed on ticket issues
   - Progress updates and status changes
   - Communication with requestor as needed

4. **Closure and Follow-up**:
   - Resolution documentation
   - Requestor approval/acceptance
   - Feedback collection and knowledge capture

### Key Functions

- **Ticket Lifecycle Management**: Tracking from creation to closure
- **Smart Assignment**: Routing tickets based on category and skills
- **SLA Monitoring**: Tracking resolution times against service level agreements
- **Task Breakdown**: Managing complex tickets with multiple tasks
- **Knowledge Capture**: Building knowledge base from ticket resolutions

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations

- **User Management**: Integration with user system for requestors and assignees
- **Team Structure**: Connection to department and team data
- **Notification System**: Alerts for new tickets, updates, and approaching deadlines
- **SML Module**: Attachment of relevant documents from Shared Media Library

### External Integrations

- **Email System**: Notifications and optional ticket creation via email
- **Calendar System**: Optional scheduling of ticket-related tasks
- **Knowledge Base**: Integration with knowledge management systems

## Data Flow

1. User creates a ticket through the interface or via email integration
2. System processes the ticket, assigning initial properties and notifications
3. Assigned staff members interact with the ticket, updating status and adding comments
4. Tasks are created and tracked as part of the resolution process
5. Upon completion, the ticket is marked as resolved and queued for closure
6. After requestor confirmation, the ticket is closed and added to historical records

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- Redux for global ticket state
- Real-time updates through Socket.IO integration
- Optimistic UI updates for responsiveness

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/tickets`: Retrieve tickets with filtering options
- `POST /api/tickets`: Create new ticket
- `PUT /api/tickets/:id`: Update existing ticket
- `GET /api/tickets/:id/history`: Get ticket history
- `POST /api/tickets/:id/comments`: Add comment to a ticket
- `POST /api/tickets/:id/tasks`: Create task for a ticket

### Notification Engine

- Real-time notifications for ticket updates
- Email notifications for key events
- Dashboard alerts for pending actions

### Search and Filtering

- Full-text search across ticket content
- Advanced filtering by status, priority, category, etc.
- Saved searches for common queries

## Best Practices and Usage Guidelines

1. **Ticket Creation**:
   - Provide clear, concise descriptions
   - Include all relevant details and attachments
   - Select appropriate categories for faster routing

2. **Ticket Assignment**:
   - Assign based on skills and workload
   - Consider SLA requirements when prioritizing
   - Update assignment when circumstances change

3. **Communication**:
   - Keep all communication within the ticket system
   - Update status regularly to reflect current state
   - Document all actions taken and decisions made

4. **Resolution and Closure**:
   - Document resolution steps for knowledge sharing
   - Verify issue resolution before closing tickets
   - Capture feedback for process improvement

5. **Reporting and Analysis**:
   - Review ticket metrics regularly
   - Identify recurring issues for systemic solutions
   - Track performance against service level targets
