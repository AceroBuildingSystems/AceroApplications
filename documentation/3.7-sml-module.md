# SML (Shared Media Library) Module

## Overview

The Shared Media Library (SML) module provides a centralized system for storing, organizing, and sharing digital assets throughout the Acero Applications ecosystem. It enables efficient management of documents, images, and other media files with robust organization, access control, and version tracking capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Models

The SML module is built around three primary data models:

#### Group Management
- **SmlGroup Model** (`src/models/sml/Group.model.ts`): Top-level organizational structure for media assets
- **SmlSubGroup Model** (`src/models/sml/SmlSubGroup.model.ts`): Secondary categorization within groups

#### File Management
- **SMLFile Model** (`src/models/sml/SMLFile.model.ts`): Core entity for file metadata, storage references, and relationships

### 2. Components

#### User Interfaces
- **Media Dashboard**: Central hub for browsing and accessing media assets
- **Upload Interface**: Tools for adding new files to the library
- **Group Management**: Interface for organizing the media structure
- **Media Viewer**: Specialized viewers for different file types

#### Operational Components
- **File Uploader**: Handles file uploading and processing
- **Search System**: Advanced search functionality for finding media
- **Version Control**: Management of file versions and history
- **Permission Manager**: Interface for controlling access rights

### 3. UI/UX Features

- **Thumbnail Previews**: Visual representation of media assets
- **Grid and List Views**: Multiple display options for browsing
- **Tag Cloud**: Visual representation of categorization
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Intuitive interactions for file management
- **Batch Operations**: Tools for working with multiple files simultaneously

## Business Logic

### Media Management Workflow

1. **Organization Setup**:
   - Creating logical group and subgroup structures
   - Defining access permissions and roles
   - Establishing naming conventions and metadata standards

2. **Content Management**:
   - Uploading and importing media assets
   - Applying metadata and categorization
   - Organizing into appropriate groups and subgroups

3. **Access and Sharing**:
   - Controlling access through permissions
   - Sharing with individuals or teams
   - Generating links for external sharing when appropriate

4. **Version Management**:
   - Tracking file versions and changes
   - Maintaining history of modifications
   - Supporting rollback to previous versions

### Key Functions

- **Hierarchical Organization**: Structured organization through groups and subgroups
- **Advanced Search**: Finding media based on metadata, content, and context
- **Version Control**: Managing file revisions and history
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions for viewing and editing media
- **Integration Capabilities**: Embedding and referencing media in other modules

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations

- **AQM Module**: Attachment of media to quotations and proposals
- **HR Wizard**: Storage of employee documents and images
- **Ticket System**: Media attachments for ticket documentation
- **User Management**: Integration with user system for access control

### External Integrations

- **Email System**: Sharing media via email links
- **Document Viewers**: Preview capabilities for various file formats
- **Office Applications**: Optional integration with productivity tools

## Data Flow

1. Media files are uploaded to the system with metadata
2. Files are processed, categorized, and stored in the appropriate structure
3. Access permissions are applied based on configuration
4. Users browse, search, and access media according to their permissions
5. Changes and updates generate new versions with history tracking
6. Integration points allow media to be used throughout the application ecosystem

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Strategy

- Secure file storage with backup mechanisms
- Optimized storage for different media types
- Thumbnail generation for visual previews

### State Management

- Redux for global media library state
- Optimized loading for large media collections
- Caching strategies for improved performance

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/sml/groups`: Retrieve media group structure
- `GET /api/sml/files`: Get files with filtering options
- `POST /api/sml/upload`: Upload new media files
- `GET /api/sml/files/:id`: Retrieve specific file metadata and content
- `PUT /api/sml/files/:id`: Update file metadata or content
- `GET /api/sml/files/:id/versions`: Retrieve version history

### Search Engine

- Full-text search across file metadata
- Content-based search for supported file types
- Filtering by multiple criteria (date, type, size, etc.)

### Security Measures

- Role-based access control for all media
- Audit logging of access and modifications
- Secure storage and transmission of sensitive media

## Best Practices and Usage Guidelines

1. **Organization Strategy**:
   - Develop a clear, consistent organizational structure
   - Use meaningful group and subgroup names
   - Apply comprehensive metadata to aid in discovery

2. **File Management**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Include relevant metadata when uploading
   - Regularly review and clean up outdated content

3. **Version Control**:
   - Document significant changes between versions
   - Maintain appropriate version history based on importance
   - Use version descriptions to explain changes

4. **Access Management**:
   - Apply the principle of least privilege for access rights
   - Regularly review and update access permissions
   - Use group-based permissions for easier management

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Compress large files when appropriate
   - Use appropriate file formats for different media types
   - Consider bandwidth limitations when sharing large media
